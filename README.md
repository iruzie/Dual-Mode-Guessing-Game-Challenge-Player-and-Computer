## 🎮 Features

- **Human vs. Computer Mode**: Take on the computer in a thrilling guessing duel where the roles are reversed. Can you outsmart the algorithm?
- **Player Guessing Mode**: Try to guess the number chosen by the computer within a limited number of attempts. Use hints and track your guesses to improve your score!

## 📜 How It Works

1. **Choose Your Mode**: Decide whether you want to guess the number or have the computer guess your number.
2. **Select Difficulty**: Pick a difficulty level to set the range of numbers and the number of attempts allowed.
3. **Start Guessing**: If you're playing against the computer, provide feedback on the computer's guesses. If the computer is guessing, you’ll need to guess within the set range.
